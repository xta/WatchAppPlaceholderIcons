# WatchAppPlaceholderIcons

# Purpose

Help organize your Apple Watch home screen during development. Instead of several unidentified watch apps without icons, quickly add a placeholder icon to each Xcode project and stay on top of your apps.

# Usage

Drag the desired icon (.png) from `icons/` into 

    Xcode > 
        __your__ WatchKit App > 
            Assets.xcassets > 
                AppIcon > 
                    Apple Watch Home Screen (All)
